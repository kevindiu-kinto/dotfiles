# Docker Network Configuration Documentation
# ==========================================
# This file documents the network settings configured in docker-compose.yml
# These are Docker Compose network settings and CANNOT be moved to Linux config files
# They must remain in docker-compose.yml as they control Docker network behavior

# Development Network Configuration
# docker-compose.yml setting:
#   networks:
#     dev-network:
#       driver: bridge

# Bridge Driver Options (Performance Optimization)
# docker-compose.yml setting:
#   driver_opts:
#     com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc: "true"           # Enable inter-container communication
#     com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade: "true" # Enable IP masquerading for external access  
#     com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4: "0.0.0.0" # Bind to all host interfaces

# Network Subnet Configuration  
# docker-compose.yml setting:
#   ipam:
#     driver: default
#     config:
#       - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16  # Private network range for containers

# Note: These settings are applied by Docker Compose when creating the network
# and cannot be configured through Linux system files.
