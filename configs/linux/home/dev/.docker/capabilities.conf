# Docker Container Capabilities Documentation
# ============================================
# This file documents the security capabilities configured in docker-compose.yml
# These are Docker runtime settings and CANNOT be moved to Linux config files
# They must remain in docker-compose.yml as they control container behavior

# Security Policy: Drop all capabilities by default
# docker-compose.yml setting:
#   cap_drop:
#     - ALL

# Essential Development Capabilities: Only add what's needed
# docker-compose.yml setting:
#   cap_add:
#     - CHOWN      # Change file ownership (needed for file operations)
#     - DAC_OVERRIDE # Override discretionary access controls (needed for sudo)
#     - FOWNER     # File ownership operations (needed for development)
#     - SETGID     # Set group ID (needed for user management)
#     - SETUID     # Set user ID (needed for user management)

# Security Options
# docker-compose.yml setting:
#   security_opt:
#     - no-new-privileges:false  # Allow privilege escalation for dev tools

# Note: These settings are applied at container runtime by Docker
# and cannot be configured through Linux system files.
